# ColorSplitter
Split images into separate whitemasks.

Made in [Processing](https://processing.org/) until I realized I only used like 2 features in Processing that are already in pure Java so I switched to Java.

The Processing source is now outdated and only the Java one should be used.

## Installation

There is no installation. Download the [lastest release](https://github.com/NitroGuy10/ColorSplitter/releases/latest) and run the .jar file. If your OS doesn't let you double-click it, open a terminal to its location and type `java -jar ColorSplitter.jar` to run it.

Oh yeah, you'll also need to have Java installed. You probably already do, but if you don't, you can download it [here](https://www.java.com/download/).
